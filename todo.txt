TODO:
- context of houses and custom items with (tutorial) from the prisons
- //make house banners (planned)
- #make houses fully operational
- #make the lives system
- #make the throne and koth function
- #finish slots
- #classes for fighting:
	- #banner ideas: choose a first banner and second banner and you can buy a special banner that allows you to place and remove the entire banner at once
	provided there is space below.
	- #wear banners for a team boost like bard.
	
- #LiveAtlas
- #create the custom item crafting idea (meals, custom armor, condensed star ore)
- #finish the minigame
- #thats pretty much it for the beginning of the server
- #then load the map 20kx20k
- #make the website
- #create the voice over lines and create the youtube shorts with 4 youtube accuonts, all different names and post each with different tags.
- #release the server shortly after and begin to collect marketing data and working on player domains and references, voting, newsletter, email list, forum, etc.
(MARKETING IDEAS/ADVERTISING IDEAS)
- #finish admin mode and recruit some small amount of staff over time
- #then continue to push out new ideas on a weekly basis. If ever I am way too busy to release anything, just release a new craftable item each week.
(If i do have time, work on instancehousing (spawn houses), long form and clever quests with an easy system to allow others to make their own quests. 
#How does bdo have so many quests [they have a team to make quests], bounties/faceless man idea, tutorial/intro, expand on raidable/powerless idea, 
class selector and classes, more custom blocks/ores/locations to mine custom blocks/ores)
- #if there are no players, then we pay a youtuber to get the word out. But the marketing idea should work. Start making your own how to play videos.
- #How to play HardcoreSMP?

BUYCRAFT ITEMS:


CUSTOM ITEMS:
- compressed star armor: cant take fire damage, can breath under water, and 1.5x netherite armor protection. Bounce on lava? Also walk on water with lilypads
- compressed star ore: spawns randomly 1/50 when mining diamond ores. It replaces the surrounding ores with compressed star ore. 1/100 when mining gold 1/250 iron.



FUTURE IDEAS:
- #Add a red woman/priestess type thing. Can affect battles with witchcraft. Make a voodoo doll out of an enemy player through fire and it can be clicked once.
- #City soundscape when you are near spawn. Some kind of livliness in spawn.
- #Builder mode (multiple saved inventories, etc. )
- #Future: leader of royal house can ride a dragon around the world. It cant do damage.
- #Future idea to flesh out: When you die, you have a chance to drop some of your items. It lists them in chat.
- #Future idea: bard will be able to combine soul of player that is a ghast tear with a totem to make a voodoo doll
