- need a lives command for personal lives as well as lives give which you can only give general lives
# also need lives give/set/take for admin
- lives can be obtained through voting, random chance while mining, (later on fishing, cooking, alchemy, random chance through everything), and trading in a nether star

- lives shop will be in the house menu. House menu right now has banners, lives shop, gold shop. (Later will have daily rewards)
